        <p>Choosing the right guitar pedals can be overwhelming with so many options available. This guide will help you make informed decisions about which pedals to add to your setup.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Consider Your Musical Style</h2>
        <p>Different genres typically rely on different types of effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blues: Overdrive, wah, reverb</li>
            <li>Rock: Distortion, delay, chorus</li>
            <li>Metal: High-gain distortion, noise gate</li>
            <li>Ambient: Reverb, delay, modulation</li>
            <li>Country: Compression, tremolo</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Essential Factors to Consider</h2>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="mb-3">
                <h3>Sound Quality</h3>
                <p>Look for pedals that maintain your tone's clarity and don't add unwanted noise.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
                <h3>Build Quality</h3>
                <p>Invest in durable pedals that can withstand regular gigging and rehearsals.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
                <h3>Power Requirements</h3>
                <p>Consider the voltage needs and power consumption of each pedal.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
                <h3>Size and Space</h3>
                <p>Think about your pedalboard size and how many pedals you can accommodate.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3">
                <h3>Budget</h3>
                <p>Balance quality with cost - sometimes it's worth investing in key effects.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
